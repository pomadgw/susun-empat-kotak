## What is this?

This project is attempt to emulating Nintendo's famous video game console Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan, or Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in rest of the world, in JavaScript.

## Why?

I want to learn on how to create emulation of other system. Also, we want to sharpen my ability and knowledge in coding a good practice JavaScript and software engineering in general.

The code itself is based on [tutorial made by javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrOv9FMX8xJHqMvSGB_9G9nZZ_4IgteYf) and the codes in this repository is partially port of his codes, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).


Includes [lj65](https://github.com/Glavin001/node-nes/tree/master/roms/lj65) game rom for play test.
